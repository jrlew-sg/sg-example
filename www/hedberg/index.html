				<h1>Escalators</h1>
				<p>I like escalators, because an escalator can never break; it can only become stairs.
					There would never be an "Escalator Temporarily Out of Order" sign.
					Only an "Escalator Temporarily Stairs... Sorry for the Convenience"</p>

				<h2>Frogs and Bears</h2>
				<p>In England, Smokey the Bear is not the forest fire prevention representative. They have Smacky the Frog.
					It's a lot like a bear, but it's a frog. I think that's a better system. I think we should adopt it.
					Because bears can be mean, but frogs are always cool. Never has there been a frog hopping toward me,
					and I thought "Man, I'd better play dead. Here comes that frog." I would never say "Here comes that
					frog" in a horrifying manner. It's always, like, optimistic. Like, "Hey, here comes that frog, all
					right. Maybe he will settle near me and I can pet him, and put him in a mayonnaise jar, with a stick
					and a leaf, to recreate what he's used to.</p>
